## What I've learned

**Functions** are just recipes and can be customized as you see fit for the problem

Using functions to: 

- display my array by calling the function name

- add a new item into my array using the push method

- changing an item by the position in the array with a new value 
and calling the function to pass in the arguments for the change to occur 

- delete an item in the array using the splice method
